# GongGeul(공글)---
* It's a simple markdown editor project inspired by Typora.
* I wanted to make a simple, both visually and functionally, productivity application.

## User Experience
* User can write an article on [this](https://swimmingkiim.github.io/markdown-editor/) page.
* User can use markdown symbols that is written on the first page.
* User can save what user wrote to "gonggeul.md" by clicking `save` button.
* User can open a markdown file.
  * But this web only understand those symbols that is written on the landing page.
  * If the file contains other symbol, it might work differently.
  * So in this stage, I recommend you use the file that created by GongGeul. I'm planning to make an improvement on this.

## Other Things...
* This project is using React but at the same time a lot of things are done by using DOM directly.
* I would really like to use more React hooks other than real DOM.
* If you have any constructive feedback on this or on user experiences, please notify me via github or comment on [this blog post](https://swimmingkiim.blogspot.com/2020/09/i-made-simple-markdown-editor-with.html).
